When dealing with space and time complexity:Omega[Big Omega], theta[Big theta] and omicron[Big Oh]

OMEGA:Best Case
THETA:Average Case
Omicron:Worst Case

n = no. of steps

O(n)  => for loop, proportional                             [O(n)+O(n)=O(2n)=>O(n)]  [O(a)+O(b)=>O(a+b)]
O(n^2) => Nested for loop, loop within a loop               [O(n^2)+O(n^2)=O(2n^2)=>O(n^2)]
O(1) => some cases where the number of steps is 1
O(log n) => applicable for sorted array, Divide and conquer
O(n log n) => for some sorts like merge and quick sort, constant time
O(n!) => Worst case
